1. Check your current branch:

git branch


2. If you see master (not main), push using:

git push -u origin master


3. If you have no commits yet, add and commit your files:

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

Then  git push -u origin master

4. If you want your branch to be called main:

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

GitHub

To push your code to a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Initialize Git (if you haven’t already):

git init

2. Add the remote repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git



Replace USERNAME and REPOSITORY with your actual GitHub username and

repository name.

3. Add your files:

git add .

4. Commit your changes:

git commit -m "Your commit message"

5. Push your code:

If this is your first push and you want to push to the main branch:

For subsequent pushes, just use:

git push

Note:

Make sure you have permission to push to the repository.

If you’re prompted, enter your GitHub username and password
 (or use a personal access token).
