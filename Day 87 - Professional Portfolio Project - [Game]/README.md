Breakout was a hit game originally coded up by Steve Wozniak before he and Jobs started Apple. It's a simple game that is similar to Pong where you use a ball and paddle to break down a wall.

Using Python Turtle, build a clone of the 80s hit game Breakout.

How to Play:

Controls:

Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move the paddle

Press R to restart the game

Press N to advance to the next level (when you've cleared all bricks)

Game Rules:

Break all the bricks to complete the level

The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks

Different colored bricks give different point values (higher rows = more points)

You start with 3 lives

If the ball goes below the paddle, you lose a life

Game Features:

Score tracking

Lives counter

Level progression

Visual feedback when hitting bricks

Game over and win screens

Paddle-based ball angle control (ball bounces at different angles depending on where it hits the paddle)
